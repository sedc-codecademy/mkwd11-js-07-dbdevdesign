# Welcome to Database Design and Development with PostgreSQL 🚀

The goal of this subject is to lay the groundworks of why data storage is important, how can we implement a data storage solution, what are databases and how to manipulate with them. We also need to keep in mind that this knowledge of databases will be used in future subjects in the academy. On this course the students will be able to learn the following:

●	What are databases
●	How to manage databases
●	How to manage data in a database
●	How to write queries, views, functions and stored procedures
 
The course will last 7 modules and will consist of new concepts as well as exercises and workshop classes in order to get one's hands on the code that is learned in class. Hope you have fun and good luck 😉
